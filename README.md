<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

A dear colleage left the company and as a gimmick I created a digital replacement of him. And as is expected from RoderickGPT, the application either responds in Dunglish <i>(A mix of broken english and dutch words)</i> or Brabant's <i>(A dutch dialect)</i>. The tool makes use of the openai api, which is trained on Roderick's data. Mostly anecdotes from other colleages, the data had to be translated and then presented in both dialects to prevent contemination from the other dataset. 

You can login using the password <b>TBWA</b>, the website will stay up till the end of 2024.
